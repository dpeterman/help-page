                <p>For Windows PCs, there's no better antivirus software than the one that Microsoft provides.  Microsoft Security Essentials seeks to be an out of the way application that keeps you safe in all your computing uses. For web browsing, downloading, and general computing, it has you covered. And best of all, it's FREE!</p>

                            If you're looking for an inexpensive computer, please don't go to the store and pick one up some Dell, HP, or "big name" computer for a few hundred dollars.
                            Usually these computers are put together with the most inexpensive materials so that they can be sold for cheap.  But with everyday life, and kids, we need computers that can withstand a little bit of rough-housing.
                            The best computers for this are business class computers.  But if you search for that, you'll most likely get results that are close to a thousand dollars.
                            But you don't need to spend this much to get a great quality computer.  Buying an off-lease business grade computer can get you a durable, high quality machine for a very low price.
                            Although they're used, these computers come with top quality materials, and hardware that's only a few years old and was top notch at its time.  The specs on these computers usually beats any of the "deal" computers at the tech stores, but for almost the same, if not less of the price.
                            Visit a site such as the <a href="http://www.dfsdirectsales.com/">Dell off-lease computer site</a> and have a look at their stock. Fair warning, these may come with a dwindling battery, so be prepared to pick one up from eBay for a few bucks. If you need any help picking a machine, just let me know.

                        <p>
                            Macs are absolutely beautiful machines, and that's where the gratitude will stop.  I personally feel like the price you pay for the hardware is fairly steep.  You will also need to understand that the user experience is far different from that of a Windows machine.  These computers are not for everyone.
                            If you're absolutely fed up with Windows, I recommend trying out Linux, or maybe borrowing a friend's Mac before making such an investment.  I would also like to squelch a few myths about Macs as well.  First, the reason they're "so fast" is because most people compare it to the frustrations they have after buying a $300 Best Buy special.
                            It would be like comparing a nice BMW 3 series to a Kia Rio, they aren't in the same category.  Second, "but Macs don't get viruses" is a complete fallacy.  They get viruses just like Windows, but because they are such a low market share (9% for many years, with Windows at 90%), people didn't bother writing viruses for them.  Now they are, and Mac users need to be aware.
                            These computer can be very difficult for others to work on and usually requires sending to Apple for repairs.  They're great machines, but a lot of consideration needs to be put in before making such a big commitment and change.
